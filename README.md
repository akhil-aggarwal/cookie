Hurray, you just made added your first issue. The managers of amazon clone will now review your issue and you will either get assigned to the issue, have it closed or a comment will be dropped for you.

You have been assigned an issue 🥂 and are confused 😵 about where to go from here, follow this guide below to make your changes and pull request 🍾.

## Getting Started
Fork the Cookie repository. See below 👇

![fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76417084/193394675-6a74ff28-68d9-44c0-bc13-d64e9ca72ffe.png)
